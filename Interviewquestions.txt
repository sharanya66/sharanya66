1.Program for converting date month year to month date year
#to convvert year month date format to date month year format
import datetime
date='2022-2-5'
dt=datetime.datetime.strptime('2022-2-5','%Y-%m-%d').strftime('%m/%d/%y')
print(dt)


2.Program for finding whether sequence of elements are unique or not
3.what is python namespace(global,local)
pgm:
a = 10 #global
def fun1():
    b=5 #local
    global a
    print(a)
    print(b)
fun1()

4.What is automation and manual testing
4.admin commands
4.sata nd nvme diff
5.sanity smoke and acceptance
6.white box and blackbox testing
7.SSD overprovisioning
8.Wht is SSD
9.What is module
10.


TCS(netapp):
First round:roles and responsibities
1.Linux commands u have worked on list out
2.write find command syntax
3.List the partitions in linux(partitions in linux)
4.How u r installing pakacges in linux(apt-get in ubuntu and yum in linux)
5.What is NQN in NVMe
6.what is ANA in NVMe
10.write test cases in linux and vmware
Second round:
1.Write a pgm for copying content of one file into another
2.Write a pgm for printing number of words,lines and characters in a file
#program has to read the file,printing num of words ,lines, characters
with open('hello.txt') as fp:
    data = fp.read()
chars_count=0
words_count=0
print(len(data))
lines_count=len(data.split('\n'))
for i in data.split('\n'):
        words_count+=len(i.split())
for i in data:
    chars_count+=1
print(lines_count)
print(words_count)
print(chars_count)
3.Write a pgm for OOPS;
#base class vehicle number of cc ,colour,reg no
#derived class number of passengers

class Vehicle():
    def __init__(self , colour , cc, reg no):
        self.colour = colour
        self.cc == cc
        self.regno = regno

class Car(Vehicle):
    def __init__(self , colour, cc, regno, Passengers):
        super().__init__(colour , cc , regno)
        self.Passengers = Passengers
    def passenger(self):
        return self.Passengers
    def display(self):
        print('I am a', self.colour,'vehicle with number of' self.Passengers)
v=Vehicle('Red',100,009)
c= Car('Blue',101,008,50)
print(c.display())
